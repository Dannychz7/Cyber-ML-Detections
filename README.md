# Cyber-ML-Detections

Welcome to my repo where I will be making some proof-of-concept Machine Learning detection tools.

## 📁 Project Overview

This repository contains various machine learning models and scripts focused on detecting cyber threats using real network traffic datasets. The goal is to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of ML-based detection methods.

## 🔧 Features

- XGBoost and PyTorch implementations
- Network traffic feature extraction and preprocessing
- Sample prediction pipelines
- Custom model training and evaluation

## 🗂 Structure

Cyber-ML-Detections/
├── DDOS_ML_Detection/ # Models and scripts for DDoS detection using both XGBoost and PyTorch
|-- Anamolous_Inbound_Traffic_Logs/ # UNDER DEV, this will be similar to DDOS_ML_Detection but will leverge more tailored fields with synthetic data


## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dannychz7/Cyber-ML-Detections.git
   cd Cyber-ML-Detections

## Obtaining Datasets

Recommended Dataset for Network Anomaly Detection:
______________________________________________________
- CIC-IDS 2017
- URL: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html

- This dataset offers a comprehensive representation of realistic network traffic, encompassing various attack types such as botnets Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, and brute-force intrusions.
- It includes essential network flow features, including Flow Bytes/s, Source IP, Destination IP, Protocol, and Flow Duration.
- Ideal for: Developing and evaluating solutions for inbound/outbound traffic volume anomaly detection.
